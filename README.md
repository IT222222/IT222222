For about 8 years, I've been working as a Backend Developer with ASP.NET, laravel and django.
As the modern Javascript technologies came in, rather than using server side rendering technologies tuned up with jQuery, I have been using Node.js, Angular.js, React.js for 5+ years for Frontend development.

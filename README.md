Over +10 years, I've been working as a Software Engineer for small to medium sized company.
My major parts are python, django and React.
As the modern Javascript technologies came in, rather than using server side rendering technologies tuned up with jQuery, I have been using Node.js, Angular.js for 5+ years for Frontend development.
